# scalaML

Implement some ML algorithms in scala. 

1.  base bgd, sgd, mbgd to get started.
2.  Frequently-used GD algosï¼š 
    -   SGD with momentum and NAG
    -   AdaGrad
    -   AdaDelta
    -   RMSProp
    -   Adam/AdaMax/Nadam
    -   FTRL_Proximal(online learning)
3.  Quasi-Newton Methods
    -   DFP with golden section method
    -   BFGS with golden section method
4.  common loss function for binary classification.


**note**: 
1.  this is just tested for binary classification(especially logloss) now.
