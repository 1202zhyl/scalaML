# scalaML

Implement some ML algorithms in scala. 

1.  base bgd, sgd, mbgd to get started.
2.  Frequently-used SGD algosï¼š 
    -   SGD with momentum and NAG
    -   AdaGrad
    -   AdaDelta
    -   RMSProp
    -   Adam
    -   FTRL_Proximal(online learning)
    -   DFP with golden section method
    -   BFGS with golden section method
3.  common loss function.


**note**: 
1.  this is just tested for binary classification(especially logloss) now.
