Implement some ML algorithms in scala. 

1.  base bgd, sgd, mbgd to get started.
2.  Frequently-used SGD algosï¼š 
    -   SGD with momentum and NAG
    -   adagrad
    -   adadelta
    -   rmsprop
    -   adam
    -   FTRL_Proximal(online learning)
3.  common loss function.


**note**: 
1.  this is just tested for binary classification(especially logloss) now.
